    <h1> United States Housing Market Case Study </h1>

    <p>The US real estate and housing market plays a big role not only in the US economy, but also the world economy. </p>
    <p>In the individual level, homes are often the single biggest source of a household’s source of equity and wealth. In this aspect, large swings in housing market can cause great impact to both homeowners and potential home buyers. For example, a large increase in home equity can result in households being priced out of their neighborhoods, and large decreases in home equity can cause homeowners to be trapped in their home loan with a negative home equity. </p>
    <p>In the macroeconomic level, the changes in housing market behavior can cause large economic impacts in the US economy and even the world economy. They account for a large portion of a country’s GDP, as well as a big portion of income for the government through taxes. Irregular and unhealthy housing market behavior can cause dire effects for the world economy. For example, in the 2007-2008 financial crisis, cheap credit and lax lending standards fueled a housing bubble that when popped, caused a world-wide financial crisis. </p>
    <p>The US housing market have been steadily increasing in the past 9 years, with the median house price almost doubling from $151 000 in January of 2012, to $326 000 in January of 2021 in spite of a lot of events happening all around the world. </p>
    <p> Zooming in on this, we also find that the housing market has been behaving quite irregularly in the past 2 years, in lieu of the pandemic. This visualization analyzes this irregularity. </p>

    <h1> Metrics Measuring Surge </h1>
    <p>The United States experienced a surge in house prices in the past 3 years. From the second half of 2020 to this date, we see unprecedented growth in housing market demand across the US. As shown in the previous graph, we see a growth in median house price of 18% year over year just from January 2020 to January 2021 alone. </p>

    <p>Other key metrics to look out for that supports the thesis that there has been a surge in housing market demand across the US is the “Average Days on Market” metric and the “Average Home Sold above Listing Metric”. </p>

    <p>The “Average Days on Market” metric is used to measure how long a house is listed in MLS before the seller accepts an offer from a buyer. This generally follows a year-to-year trend, where the average days on market dips during house buying season, which typically happens in the Summer. However, we see a very interesting trend in the housing market the past 3 years. During the peak buying season of Summer 2020, we see an increase in this metric is caused by buyer fear of an incoming recession caused by the pandemic. However, as time goes by and as first-time homebuyers and investors alike gains confidence on the economy, we see a continuous downwards trend in “Average Days on Market” through the rest of the year, breaking normal trendlines. This dip reached a low of 23 days on November 2020, which is the lowest value reached in the past 3 years. </p>

    <p>The “Average Home Sold Price Above Listing Percentage” metric measures how much of a premium a buyer has to pay in order to get under contract with a seller. In a seller’s market, it is not uncommon for buyers to bid more than $50 000 on a $500 000 home to outbid other potential buyers. In fact, a piece of property in D.C. listed for $260 000 sold for $460 000 – almost 80% above listing price. This property had a total of 88 offers in 4 days. </p>

    <h1> Reasons behind Surge </h1>
    <p> As with basic supply and demand economics, there are two main reasons why we are seeing an increase in house market prices in the US. </p>
    <p>First, we see an increase in demand of both first-time homeowners as well as real estate investors. To stimulate the economy, the federal reserve has systematically slashed interest rates to make it cheaper to borrow money. This increases homeowner’s affordability as they now can purchase a home that was previously outside of their budget. As a result of this, a standard 30-year-fixed interest rate can go as low as 2.75%, which is the lowest interest rate value in the US housing market in history. This very fact, coupled with increased work from home flexibility resulted increased demand for non-homeowners to jump in the market, and for homeowners to upsize their current home. </p>
    <p>Second, we see a decreased supply in new houses in the US over the past year. In 2020, the US experienced a raw material crisis caused by nationwide lock downs to curb the spread of the disease. As seen in the graphs below, Lumber prices in September of 2020 essentially doubled that of what it was in September 2019, and Steel prices in December of 2020 almost doubled of that of December 2018. As a result, house material prices like lumber and steel skyrocketed, limiting the supply of new homes in the US. </p>
    <p> This lack of housing inventory, coupled with the increased housing demand has caused a housing market surge in 2020. </p>
